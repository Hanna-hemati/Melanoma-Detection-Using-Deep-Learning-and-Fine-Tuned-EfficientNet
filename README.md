# Melanoma-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-and-Fine-Tuned-EfficientNet
 A deep learning-based intelligent assistant for dermatologists to classify skin lesions from dermoscopic images as benign or malignant (melanoma). This project uses the ISIC dataset (25,000 images) and applies transfer learning by fine-tuning an EfficientNet model to achieve high classification accuracy.
